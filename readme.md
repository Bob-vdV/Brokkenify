#Brokkenify

### Introduction
Tired of getting flamed because you forgot to write ++c instead of c++, or you used an int instead of a size_t in a loop?

Fear no more! This program is designed to scan your exercises for anything that does not comply with Brokken's C++ styles.


### How does it work?
The program is a simple python script that works with regular expressions to check each file. 

Note that this means that this program cannot catch everything. See [the abbreviations](./abbreviations.md) for more details.
