Assignment: Convert text input to binary output.

Input: a text file containing double-precision floating-point numbers,
       a vector of doubles if you will.

Write a program that does the following:
- It reads the input file name from the command line.
- It reads an optional cutoff number from the command line.
- It reads the numbers from file into memory, and reports the number of items read.
- If the cutoff is given, it truncates the vector at that number of items.
- It writes the vector to a binary output file (using whatever representation
  the numbers have in RAM).

Use a class to represent the vector of doubles.

Submit the source files and (internal) header files you wrote.
